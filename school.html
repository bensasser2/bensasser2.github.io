      <h1 class="yes2">School Involvement</h1>
      <p class="para2">During the time I have spent at my current school, I have become involved with numerous groups. I joined a student-formed drama club last school year, and was able to be part of a show in which we performed fifteen short plays in less than half an hour. Close to the end of that school year, I also decided to run for secretary of student council and was voted into the position. As secretary, I have been able to serve this school year by creating announcement slides for morning meeting presentations, managing a committee who is in charge of publicizing school events, and assisting in setup for multiple school events. This school year, I have also been able to become involved with a newly-created eSports club, and recently helped with setup of a game tournament the club held.</p>
      <h1 class="yes2">Education Opportunities</h1>
      <p class="para2">My school has provided me with the opportunity to be one of few students pursuing an Associate's Degree in Computer Science as a high school student who will graduate in June of 2020. This has allowed me to accelerate the rate at which I complete certain courses, and as a result, I finished my high school math and science courses in my sophomore year. I have also had the opportunity to learn quite a bit about programming while in school, both last year and this year. I have been able to learn about Python and Java, as well as web development using HTML and CSS. I am currently in a computer science internship held at my school taught by MAXX Potential. During this internship, I have been able to learn about web development, as well as various aspects of the computer science industry.</p>
